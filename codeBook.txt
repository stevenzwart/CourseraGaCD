This file describes the process of cleaning up the data for this project

First the tables X_test.txt and subject_test.txt are loaded as tables
Then only the relevant variables (the ones with standard deviation or mean) are selected into a new table

The same process happens with the tables X_train.txt and subject_train.txt

The column in the subject tables becomes the first column in a new table, where the other data already resides. This is done with the rbind command

All columns are given meaningful names

Then the test and training data are merged into a new table, this is done with the command cbind.

Finally a new table tidyData is created which contains the means of all the mean variables per subject.
